    "Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other. It offers products or services to communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented.\n",

    "Advantages of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: API produces efficient, quicker, and more reliable results than the outputs produced by human beings in an organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible delivery of services: API provides fast and flexible delivery of services according to developers’ requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration: The best feature of API is that it allows the movement of data between various sites and thus enhances the integrated user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automation: As API makes use of robotic computers rather than humans, it produces better and more automated results.\n",
    "\n",
    "New functionality: While using API the developers find new tools and functionality for API exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost: Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintenance and support from developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security issues: Using API adds another layer of surface which is then prone to attacks, and hence the security risk problem is common in APIs."
